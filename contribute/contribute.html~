      </h2>
      <p>
        Once upon a time a little nerd wanted to learn all he could about
        space. Especially space vehicles. He watched all the YouTube videos,
        read all the journal articles, and even stalked all the space companies
        he could find. Being an engineer by trade he dove deeper and deeper into the 
        research. He wanted to know everything; not only about each spacecraft's 
        mission, but even their design, manufacture, and instrumentation.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        One night after a long day of surfing the interwebs, he increasingly became
        more and more frustrated at NASA's websites. They felt disjointed.. disorganized.
        He began to loathe the fact that some sites contained mere marketing for
        a mission, while another could be as detailed as a systems engineer's personal documentation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then he had a thought. What if there was a place where all peple could go to get 
        as much public knowledge as possible about a spacecraft? What if there was a simply designed, easily navigatable resource that anybody could use to learn about humanity's greatest engineering achievements? A one stop shop for spacecraft education and entertainment?
